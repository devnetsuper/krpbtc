			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>
				<strong>KRP BTC</strong> is a framework for verifying cryptocurrency transactions. It provides a guide for financial
				professionals that ensures:
			<ul>
				<li>Best audit practices set by Canadian regulators.</li>
				<li>Efficient ways of verifying cryptocurrency transactions on-chain.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				The main value props of KRP BTC are:
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Internal Libraries: </strong> most cryptocurrency transactions settle on open, permissionless blockchains that allow us to
				develop scripts that extract raw data.</li>
				<li><strong>Data Classification: </strong> the raw data extracted is then organized in an accountant-friendly manner integrated with
				Excel.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>

				<h1>Work Specialization</h1>
				<hr>
				<p>Here are the technical controls set in place to meet the industry standards and regulations for the auditing of cryptocurrencies.</p>
				<h4>Verification of transactions</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Ensure all transactions have been settled on the blockchain.</li>
					<li>Match data provided by client, with a focus on date of transaction, transaction hash, amount transacted, asset type and destination address.</li>
					<li>Determine the status of the transaction as verified or invalid.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Transaction dashboard</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Organize data clumps in an accountant-friendly manner.</li>
					<li>Label transactions as incoming or outgoing.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Daily price and historical data</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Get the closing price of major assets at any time frame.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Transaction rollback</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Determine the balance of any wallet address at year-end (or custom date).</li>
					<li>Perform any tasks related to ownership ceremonies, such as ownership ceremony rollbacks.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Unrealized gains or losses</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Provide the closest P/L estimate per transaction for every major asset, and inevitably get the closest estimate of wallet address P/L.</li>
				</ul>

				<h1>Formalization</h1>
				<hr>
				<p>This section provides instructions for organizing client data for blockchain transaction verification and a list of resources used in the process should be considered the standard for on-chain work.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Preparing client data for on-chain verification</li>
					<li>Reliable resources by AICPA</li>
					<li>Mining operations and activities</li>
					
				</ul>
				<h4>How to Prepare Client Files</h4>
				<p>The client will provide us with a .csv file containing the raw data from their wallet addresses. To verify the transactions on the blockchain, we can focus on the following data points:</p>
				<table>
					<tr>
						<th>Transaction Hash</th>
						<th>Server Time</th>
						<th>Transaction Value</th>
						<th>Asset</th>
						<th>Destination Address</th>
					</tr>
				</table>
				
				<p><strong>We can also request the client's addresses and retrieve these data internally.</strong></p>
				<h4>Reliable Block Explorers by AICPA</h4>
				<p>Each network has its own set of tools used for blockchain exploration. Cryptocurrencies are open-source projects, and most of the tools out there are free and used by accountants and developers all over the world.</p>
				<table>
					<tr>
						<th>Asset/s or Network</th>
						<th>Block Explorer URL</th>

				<h4>Mining Operations and Activities</h4>
				<p>The strategy to test revenue is almost identical for all proof-of-work networks. There are three components that will determine the profitability of operations:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Hardware capacity</li>
					<li>Client's network hash rate share</li>
					<li>Operational expenses (electricty, mining fees)</li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>Hardware capacity</strong></p>
				<p>Since mining is a highly monopolized field, most likely the mining equipment is being made by the same companies. All we are concerned with is determining 3 specific characteristics of any mining equipment:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Hash rate capacity</li>
					<li>Power consumption</li>
					<li>Mining algorithm</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The hardware specifications are easy to gather. On your web browser type “equipment model in question + specs”.</p>
				<p><strong>Client's network hash rate share</strong></p>
				<p>The formula to calculate our client’s percentage of the total network hash rate that their miner represents is the following:</p>
				<p><span>Client's hash rate share = equipment hash rate/ daily network hash rate</span></p>
				<p>Now, we have to determine the total daily block reward. So for example, a Bitcoin block is mined every 10 minutes or so:</p>
				<p><span>Daily block reward = Mining reward * blocks per day</span></p>
				<p>Finally, we have to determine the amounts of coins we will get according to our mining capacity:</p>
				<p><span>Client’s daily coins = total daily block reward * client’s hash rate share</span></p>
				<p><strong>Mining algorithm</strong></p>
				<p>The mining algorithm will determine the asset being mined. For example, if our client mines using NVIDIA GPUs, we automatically know they are not mining for Bitcoin. Maybe back in the early years, when Bitcoin mining wasn’t as competitive, however, now it would be virtually impossible to compete against ASIC miners.</p>

				<h1>Introduction to Open Bitcoin for Excel</h1>
				<hr>
				<p>Open Bitcoin for Excel (“openbtc” for short) is an open-source web application that provides detailed wallet information about prices, transactions, and blockchain confirmations more directly into Excel. It was born from a lack of existing libraries.</p>
				<h4>Project Description and Capabilities</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Address checker: verify if an address is real and settles on-chain.</li>
					<li>Transaction verification: upload an .xlsx file with bitcoin transactions and receive an output file with their respective block explorer URL.</li>
					<li>Transaction hash search: enter a transaction hash and receive a block explorer URL if the hash is found on-chain.</li>
					<li>Retrieve historical transactions: enter a bitcoin address and select the custom date range for transaction search.</li>
					<li>Calculate estimated unrealized gains or losses</li>
					<li>Historical price data: retrieve the closing price of bitcoin at a custom date range from major exchanges.</li>
